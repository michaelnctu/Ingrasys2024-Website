          <p>High availability (HA) is the ability of a system to continuously operate without failing for a specified
            period of
            time. It eliminates single point of failure and automatically failover to redundant components to minimize
            downtime.</p>

          <h>Enhance management efficiency</h>
          <p>In CDI environment, the resources dynamically composed via API or composer to meet different workload
            needs. User can
            easily compose server node on-the-fly. Scale up or down through software. No need to spend much efforts to
            change the
            underlying architecture, so this can reduce lots of deployment time.</p>

          <h>Optimize CAPEX and OPEX</h>
          <p>CDI avoids over-provisioning of resources and reduces human efforts in routine operations of underlying
            infrastructure.
            It spends less on infrastructure and operation so can optimize CAPEX and OPEX.</p>
